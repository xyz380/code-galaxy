# Data Wrangling Activities

## 1. Removed Unnecessary Columns
- Identified and removed irrelevant columns.
- Removed columns with low variance or that didnâ€™t contribute to analysis.

## 2. Renamed Columns for Clarity
- Renamed column headers for better clarity and consistency.
- Example: "M" changed to "Male" for consistency in gender representation.

## 3. Removed Years with Empty Data
- Removed rows where the year column had empty or missing data.
- Cleaned the dataset by removing irrelevant years.

## 4. Pivoted Years into One Row
- Years were spread across multiple columns.
- Pivoted them into one single row and named the column "Year."

## 5. Pivoted KPI Variables into Separate Rows
- Different KPI variables were initially in one row.
- Pivoted them into individual rows for clearer analysis.

## 6. Arranged Tableau Fields
- Organized fields in Tableau for better visualization.
- Ensured logical order for more efficient data analysis and presentation.
