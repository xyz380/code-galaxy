# Building Resilient Infrastructure, Promoting Inclusive and Sustainable Industrialization, and Fostering Innovation  
*A Decision Intelligence Analysis of UN Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG 9)*  

By: Siddharth Koyada

## Executive Summary  

Infrastructure is the backbone of economic growth, social development, and technological progress. However, many regions still lack reliable infrastructure, leading to inefficiencies in transportation, energy, and industrial development. Sustainable industrialization and innovation are critical for economic resilience, environmental sustainability, and reducing inequalities.  

This project aims to analyze global infrastructure development, industrialization trends, and innovation metrics. Using open datasets, it explores the relationship between infrastructure investments, economic growth, and sustainable industrial policies. The goal is to identify key factors that drive resilient and inclusive industrialization while fostering technological advancements.
