# Background: Building Resilient Infrastructure, Promoting Inclusive and Sustainable Industrialization, and Fostering Innovation  

## Problem Context  

Infrastructure plays a vital role in economic growth, social development, and environmental sustainability. However, developing nations face severe infrastructure gaps, while even advanced economies struggle with aging systems. Without resilient infrastructure, businesses suffer from inefficiencies, communities remain disconnected, and economies fail to reach their full potential.  

Sustainable industrialization ensures economic progress without depleting natural resources, while innovation drives technological advancements and economic competitiveness. The United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG 9) aims to:  

1. Develop quality, reliable, sustainable, and resilient infrastructure.  
2. Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization.  
3. Support research, innovation, and technological advancements.  

With rapid urbanization and climate change concerns, a data-driven approach is needed to assess infrastructure quality, industrialization trends, and innovation levels. Understanding the global landscape will help policymakers, businesses, and researchers implement effective solutions for long-term economic resilience.
